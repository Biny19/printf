0. Write a function that produces output according to a format.

•	Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);

•	Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)

•	write output to stdout, the standard output stream

•	format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:

o	c

o	s

o	%

•	You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function

•	You don’t have to handle the flag characters

•	You don’t have to handle field width

•	You don’t have to handle precision

•	You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

1. Handle the following conversion specifiers:

•	d

•	i

•	You don’t have to handle the flag characters

•	You don’t have to handle field width

•	You don’t have to handle precision

•	You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

2. Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:

•	b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary

3. Handle the following conversion specifiers:

•	u

•	o

•	x

•	X

•	You don’t have to handle the flag characters

•	You don’t have to handle field width

•	You don’t have to handle precision

•	You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

4. Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.

5. Handle the following custom conversion specifier:

•	S : prints the string.

•	Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)

6. Handle the following conversion specifier: p.

•	You don’t have to handle the flag characters

•	You don’t have to handle field width

•	You don’t have to handle precision

•	You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

7. Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers:

•	+

•	space

•	#

8. Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:

•	l

•	h

Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X

9. Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

10. Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

11. Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

12. Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

13. Handle the following custom conversion specifier:

•	r : prints the reversed string

14. Handle the following custom conversion specifier:

•	R: prints the rot13'ed string

15. * All the above options work well together.
